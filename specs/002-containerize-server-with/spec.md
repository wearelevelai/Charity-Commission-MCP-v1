# Feature Specification: Containerize server, caching/limits, k6 gate, API reference

**Feature Branch**: `002-containerize-server-with`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Containerize server with Docker + GHCR publish workflow; add in-memory cache + rate limiter; add k6 tests + CI gate; generate an API reference from JSON Schemas."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed description present
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Containerization, image publishing, in-memory cache, rate limiting, k6 performance gate, schema-based API reference
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Desired rate limits and TTLs? Defaults will be conservative]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Supported platforms for images (amd64 only vs multi-arch)?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where to host API reference (repo docs vs wiki)?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Completed below
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Drafted below (testable)
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Contracts and generated API reference
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec contains a few clarifications; acceptable for initial PR
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

 
### Primary User Story

As a developer or operator, I want the MCP server to be containerized and published to a registry so I can deploy it consistently. I also want predictable performance with basic rate limiting and caching, and a simple way to verify latency in CI. Finally, I want a single API reference page generated from our JSON Schemas so integrators can understand inputs/outputs.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a tagged release, when CI runs, then a container image is published to our registry with appropriate tags and metadata.
2. Given repeated identical requests within a short window, when calling search/content endpoints, then responses are served from a short-lived cache and upstream calls decrease.
3. Given a burst of requests exceeding a fixed threshold, when traffic hits the server, then clients receive 429 responses and the server remains stable.
4. Given CI execution, when the k6 smoke/performance test runs, then the run passes defined thresholds or fails the job if not met.
5. Given the contracts directory, when the schema documentation job runs, then a single markdown API reference page is produced from the JSON Schemas.

### Edge Cases

- Cache staleness on upstream failure should be surfaced via an explicit error code if stale content is served.
- Rate limiting must not block health and metrics endpoints.
- CI should tolerate temporary registry hiccups by retrying the publish step.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST be buildable as a container image from repo root and expose a single HTTP port.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST publish container images to the organization‚Äôs registry on tagged pushes.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide an in-memory cache that reduces repeat upstream calls within a short TTL.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST enforce a simple, global rate limit and return HTTP 429 when exceeded.
- **FR-005**: The CI pipeline MUST include a k6 smoke/performance gate with latency and success thresholds.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST generate an API reference markdown file from JSON Schemas in contracts.
- **FR-007**: The API reference MUST list schema file names, required fields, and properties with types.
- **FR-008**: The pipeline MUST fail if the k6 thresholds are not met.
- **FR-009**: The pipeline MUST upload the generated API reference as an artifact.
- **FR-010**: The publish job MUST tag the image with the release tag and "latest".
- **FR-011**: Health and metrics endpoints MUST remain unthrottled by rate limiting.

#### Ambiguities to confirm

- **FR-012**: Cache TTLs SHOULD be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: proposed 30‚Äì60s].
- **FR-013**: Rate limit SHOULD be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: proposed 60 req/min global].
- **FR-014**: Image platforms SHOULD be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: proposed linux/amd64 only initially].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **API Contracts**: JSON Schema files that define request/response shapes for tool endpoints.
- **API Reference Document**: Generated markdown summarizing titles, types, required fields, and properties.
