# Live response examples

These examples capture representative live responses returned by the MCP server when querying GOV.UK.

- get_content_by_path.json → Example for a known GOV.UK path
- get_content_by_id.json → Example for the same item fetched by content_id

Note: We avoid committing very large payloads; these are trimmed to core, stable fields.
